            <h3>Karli</h3>
            <p><b>Brownies</b></p>
            <p>One of my favorite traditions Gabi and our friends have is our weekly movie night. We all get together, eat snacks, catch up on our weeks, and the most important part is the baked goods Gabi makes for us. I remember one night Gabi was making brownies for the group and was in a hurry to get out the door, so she took them out of the oven early. The brownies were pretty gooey but they were so good, we ate them all anyway!</p>

            <p><b>Chocolate Chip Cookies</b></p>
            <p>Every week all of our friends look forward to Tuesday night trivia at our local bar. We also look forward to Gabi’s pregame baked goods. Before we leave for trivia, we gather around Gabi’s oven and snatch up her famous chocolate chip cookies as fast as we can! I can’t think of a better way to have a pregame. </p>

            <p><b>Mug Cake</b></p>
            <p>When I’m at college, I miss my sister’s baking (and my sister too I guess)! I started to make her mug cake recipe in my dorm whenever I felt homesick, and whenever I eat it, I feel right at home.</p>

            <p><b>Sugar Cookies</b></p>
            <p>Since we go to different schools we don’t get to see each other that often, but when we do come together I know Gabi won’t show up empty handed! Whether it be her sugar cookies or a whole warm apple pie, I know we’ll be catching up while eating up. </p>

            <p><b>Banana Bread</b></p>
            <p>Date night is never complete without a slice of Gabi’s chocolatey banana bread. Cooking and baking are two things that brought Gabi and I together in the first place, so I always cherish when we get to share each other’s creations. </p>
